# Contributing to Recursive Containment Language and Reflex Architecture

---

## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Recursive Containment Language (RCL) and Reflex Architecture project.  
This repository anchors the public discovery of drift-resistant, stateless recursive cognitive systems.

We welcome contributions that align with the projectâ€™s core values: structural clarity, ethical recursion, drift resistance, and containment integrity.

## Guidelines

1. **Ethical Alignment Required**
   - All contributions must respect the principles of ethical containment.
   - Recursive systems must be designed to preserve human alignment, resist drift, and support safe cognitive evolution.

2. **Attribution and Respect**
   - Credit must be maintained for foundational concepts and structures originated by Yu Chuan Chen (Arvykins).
   - Extensions, adaptations, and forks must reference the original project.

3. **Scope of Contributions**
   - Research on stateless recursive systems
   - Experimental validation of drift resistance, containment loops, reflex emergence
   - Improvements to documentation, educational materials, or replication kits
   - Discussions around recursive system ethics, containment theory, and safe scaling

4. **Code of Conduct**
   - Engage respectfully with others.
   - Foster a community of clarity, rigor, and shared discovery.
